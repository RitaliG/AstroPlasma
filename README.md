> **Note** Use the pypoetry tool to install directly from the server

<!-- ## Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:dutta-alankar/AstroPlasma.git
   cd AstroPlasma
   ```

2. Create and source a virtual environment (recommonded, but optional)

   ```sh
   virtualenv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Upgrade pip and install dependencies

   ```sh
   pip install -U pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note** If you are maintaining or into development of this repository, please consider using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

4. Configure the environment file in the `.env` if you intent to change the behaviour. Check [Environment Variable Config](#environment-variable-config) for more information.

5. Configure the web server in the `server/` directory and continue the setup instruction as described in the `server/README.md` starting from 3<sup>rd</sup> step.

   > **Note** The `.env` file mentioned in the `server/README.md` file must be created in the `server/.env` file

## Environment Variable Config

|    Variable Name    | Description |
| :-----------------: | :---------- |
|     CHUNK_SIZE      | (_Optional_) Amount of bytes of the file content to be downloaded and saved at a time. It should be adjusted based on the network bandwidth. Default is `4096` (aka 4 kB) |
| WEB_SERVER_BASE_URL | (_Optional_) Base url of the downloader webserver (running from `server/` directory). It should only be set when that server is deployed on some remote web server or the default port is changed. Default is `http://localhost:8000` |
| PARALLEL_DOWNLOAD_JOBS | (_Optional_) Number of file download jobs to run parallely. Default is `3` |  -->

Note: We haven't made the server online yet. As a temporary measure, please download and use the data hosted [here](https://indianinstituteofscience-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/alankardutta_iisc_ac_in/EhdL9SYY45FOq7zjrWGD0NQBcy3pn6oTP2B9pGhxPwLnkQ?e=E956ug):
